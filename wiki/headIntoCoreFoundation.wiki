#summary The basic knowledge of our Cute Friend - Core Foundation.

= Introduction =

Core Foundation:
  * is a library
  * defines opaque types
  * enables sharing of code and data among various frameworks and libraries
  * makes some degree of operating-system independence possible
  * supports internationalization with Unicode strings
  * provides common API and other useful capabilities, including a plug-in architecture, XML property lists, and preferences
  
= Details =

== Opaque Types ==

 An opaque type
[http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFDesignConcepts/Art/opaquetypes.gif]

_A number of Core Foundation and Cocoa instances can simply be type-cast to each other, such as CFString and NSString objects._

== Polymorphic Functions ==

Polymorphic Functions can:
  * take any Core Foundation object as a parameter
  * return any Core Foundation object

Use polymorphic functions for:
  * reference counting
  * comparing objects
  * hashing objects
  * inspecting objects

== Three Basic Varieties ==

  * immutable and fixed size
  * mutable and fixed size
  * mutable and variable size

_Note:_ CFString and CFArray, can create all three flavors of objects.

== Memory Management ==

_For using Core Foundation in a reference counted environment._

Summery: "release" values *if and only if* having “copy” or “create” in their name.

These four are equivalent:

{{{
NSString *str = [[NSString alloc] initWithCharacters: ...];
...
[str release];
}}}

{{{
CFStringRef str = CFStringCreateWithCharacters(...);
 ...
CFRelease(str);
}}}

{{{
NSString *str = (NSString *)CFStringCreateWithCharacters(...);
 ...
[str release];
}}}

{{{
NSString *str = (NSString *)CFStringCreateWithCharacters(...);
 ...
[str autorelease];
}}}
