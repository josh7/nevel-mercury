# Introduction #

This wiki is supposed to clear and strengthen our design principles of Mercury.
When we are confused, inner conflicted, exhausted, or swamped by too much details, we may need to come here to take a breath.

  * **humanistic design**
  * **master of making**
  * **strategic thinking**
